"""Smoke coverage for nested-repository handling during a filesystem walk.

A child directory that is itself a Lore working copy (it carries its own
`.lore/`) is an implicit boundary on every walk: the parent must not index it or
pull its contents into the parent tree. A directory the parent had already
staged before becoming one is discarded with its subtree, since the parent has
no committed base it could report a deletion against.
